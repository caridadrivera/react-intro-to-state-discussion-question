Add an input field. As you type, the value of the field should show up below in a `<p>` tag.

The two values (what's in the form input and what's in the p tag) should *always be in sync*.

This means even if we added some arbitrary rule, such as if the user types the letter 'x' it will not show up, both values will always be the same.
